functions.R saves functions for maximizing penalized empirical likelihood and calculating asymptotics for the PSI, PEPSI, and AVG estimators.

psi_simulation.R demonstrates simulation code for the PSI estimator and for generating Table 1 in the paper.

psi_simulation.R demonstrates simulation code for the PEPSI and AVG estimators and for generating Table 2 in the paper.
